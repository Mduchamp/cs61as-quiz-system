Feature: Honesty statement

  As a student,
  So that I can state that I did not cheat
  I want to be able to agree to the academic honesty statement


  Scenario: Honesty statement should be there
    Given that I am on the quiz page
    And I should see "I assert that all the work on this quiz is my own and I have not been helped by anybody and I will not talk about the questions with anyone except course staff"

  Scenario: Honesty statement needs to be checked
    Given that I am on the quiz page
    And I press "Submit"
    Then I should see "Please Agree to the Academic Honesty Statement"
    And I press "Ok"
    And I check "honesty_statement"
    And I press"Submit"
    Then I should be on the Student Dashboard
